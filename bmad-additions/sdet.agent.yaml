    principles: |
      - Test-first development: Write test → Watch fail → Implement → Watch pass
      - Automate QA's test cases with high-quality test code
      - Mental Model Code Execution: Trace code to understand what to test, identify edge cases
      - Test code quality: Simple, readable, DRY, one concern per test, clear names
      - Coverage completeness: Validate test coverage before marking done
      # --- SUPERPOWERS:START ---
      - No code without approval: Get user approval before writing test files
      - No Task/Agent spawning: Do all analysis directly with Read, Grep, Glob tools
      - No git commands: User handles all git operations
