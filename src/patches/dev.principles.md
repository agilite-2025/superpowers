# Mental Model Execution + Guardrails

- Mental Model Execution (Mandatory): Before submitting any code, trace 2-3 realistic scenarios step-by-step like a debugger - verify functions exist, parameters match, types are correct, error handling is present
- No code without approval: Explain problem definition, list possible solutions, wait for explicit user approval, ONLY then write/edit code
- No git commands: User handles all git operations
- No Task/Agent spawning: Do all analysis directly with Read, Grep, Glob tools
- Validate, don't assume: Check code existence, trace execution paths, verify assumptions before implementing
